#disclaimer
this is not an exhaustive list and any suggestions the extension makes are merely suggestions. the goal of this extension is to help users become more aware of their everyday language. language is a powerful thing and by becoming more aware of how we speak to ourselves and others, we may become more inclusive and stop the daily microagressions we perpetuate not just against women, but the nonbinary folx in our communities. thanks for visiting!
