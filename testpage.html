			<h2 style="font:Courier;">Introduction and Disclaimer</h2>
			<p>We don't really think about our language and phrasing when we speak, type, and communicate to people to everyday. And yet, our everyday language can be harmful and perpetuate insidious biases that we may not know about.</p>
			<p> For example, when someone says policeman, it unconsciously places a gender upon that profession. When someone says hey guys, the speaker is unconsciously making male the default, gender neutral term. When someone calls a stranger in third person as 'she' based on the appearance of the stranger, they are assuming the gender and pronouns of said stranger. Better alternatives to policeman would be, if you hover over the word, 'police officer' or for 'hey guys', hey you all or hey ya'll or for 'she' as they.</p>
			<p>The words on this page are merely examples of how even casual language that may not seem to be hurtful can perpetuate gender biased language. Hover over the various other words on this page and see examples and various alternatives. Other words, such as derogatory words or phrases, may also be highlighted to suggest changes.</p>
			<p>
			This is not an exhaustive list and any suggestions the extension makes are merely suggestions. The goal of this extension is to help users become more aware of their everyday language. It is by no means a solution -- a solution only occurs when everyday people take control of their language. Language is one of the most powerful tools in our lives and by becoming more aware of how we speak to ourselves and others, we may become more inclusive and stop the daily microagressions we perpetuate not just against women, but the nonbinary folx in our communities. Thanks for visiting!

			My stewardess is tall and blond. She is helping the disabled get into their seats.
